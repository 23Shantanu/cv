    <h2><strong>HTML</strong></h2>
    <hr size="3" noshade="">

    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or <b>HTML</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and
        scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript.</b></p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
        and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
        create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
        links, quotes and other items.HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

    <hr>
     <i> HTML was created by <b>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</b></i> <!--bold (b) vs (strong)better -->
    Initial release= <b>1993</b>
    <br>
    <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed"some of the many areas in
        which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

    <hr>
    <p> HTML markup consists of <b><i>several key components</i></b>, including those called tags (and their
        attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.</p>

    <br>
    <h3><b><i><sup>1</sup>Element</i></b></h3>
    <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags,
        enclosed in angle brackets thus
        In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" and "end
        tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>

    <br>
    <h3><i><sup>2</sup>Character and entity references</i></h3>
    <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character
        references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A
        literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>

    <br>
    <h3><i><sup>3</sup>Data Types</i></h3>
    <p>HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of
        types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors,
        colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of
        character data. </p>
